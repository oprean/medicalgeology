			<p class="text-justify">Although much has been written about Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) over the past 50 years, its precise etiology is still unknown, similar to other chronic kidney disease and rather intuitive multiple factors are to be taken into account. Along time many factors have been proposed as etiological agents â€“ bacteria and viruses, heavy metals, (Pb, Cd etc.), industrial pollution, genetic factors and even astrological influences. In recent years many research groups have turned their attention to aristolochic acid (AA), a nephrotoxic and carcinogenic substance produced by the plant Aristolochia clematitis. Since BEN has similarities in patho-morphological characteristics with Chinese herbal nephropathy, a common etiology (toxic effect of the aristolochic acid) of both disorders was proposed (Staneva et al.2013). Poisoning with aristolochic acids is now one of the widely accepted factors responsible of triggering BEN, but aristolochic acid hypothesis does not explain issues like geographic restriction of the disease (A. clematitis is a plant that grows equally in endemic and non-endemic areas), and remains to be clarified what is the exact route of exposure to AA, and how AA gets to contaminate the human population. The existence of cofactors, which could explain the geographical delimitation of the disease and which could act in synergistic or additive combination with AA becomes very plausible.
